This repository contains code and documentation for a sentiment analysis project. The goal of this project is to analyze movie reviews and determine their sentiment using machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the IMDb movie review dataset, which is a large collection of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. The dataset can be obtained from the following link: [IMDb Dataset of 50k Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)

Project Tasks

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Perform data cleaning tasks such as removing HTML tags, punctuation, and special characters.
   - Convert text to lowercase and remove stopwords.
   - Perform tokenization to split the text into individual words or tokens.

2. Feature Extraction:
   - Explore different techniques for feature extraction such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.
   - Convert the preprocessed text into a numerical representation that machine learning algorithms can process.

3. Model Building:
   - Experiment with different machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), or recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
   - Train the chosen model using the preprocessed text and the corresponding sentiment labels from the dataset.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the model's strengths and weaknesses, including any potential sources of bias or error.

5. Fine-tuning and Improvements:
   - Explore techniques for improving the model's performance, such as hyperparameter tuning, different feature representations, or ensemble methods.
   - Document your experiments and compare the results to showcase the effectiveness of different approaches.

6. Model Deployment (Optional):
   - If time permits, deploy the trained sentiment analysis model in a simple web or application interface, allowing users to input their own movie reviews and receive sentiment predictions.

Deliverables

- A well-documented Jupyter Notebook or Python script showcasing the entire project workflow, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, and evaluation.
- Clear explanations of the decisions made throughout the project, including the choice of algorithms and feature representations.
- A comprehensive analysis of the model's performance, strengths, and areas for improvement.
- Any additional documentation, visualizations, or insights gained during the project.
